			<p>You charge into the cave, only to find the area brightly lit by several torches planted in the walls.
			The carcasses of several slightly bigger than average rats litter the small space. Someone has been here
			before you. You quickly check for lurking danger, only to discover the culprit sprawled smugly on a bed in the corner.<br></p>

			<p>While you had been making wrong choices, the cat had dispatching the rats and eaten the
			treasure.<br>
			On the floor in one corner, you find a single, badly tarnished gold piece. It had clear marks from the
			gnawing of the rats.

			<strong>~Recieved 1 gold piece</strong>

			As you leave, a passing pickpocket relieves you of your coin, taking the time to chide you on the lightness
			of your purse.
